              Summary
              VISOR is a tool for haplotype-specific simulations of simple and complex structural variants (SVs). The method is applicable to haploid, diploid or higher ploidy simulations for bulk or single-cell sequencing data. SVs are implanted into FASTA haplotypes at single-basepair resolution, optionally with nearby single-nucleotide variants. Short or long reads are drawn at random from these haplotypes using standard error profiles. Double- or single-stranded data can be simulated and VISOR supports the generation of haplotype-tagged BAM files. The tool further includes methods to interactively visualize simulated variants in single-stranded data. The versatility of VISOR is unmet by comparable tools and it lays the foundation to simulate haplotype-resolved cancer heterogeneity data in bulk or at single-cell resolution.
            
            
              Availability and implementation
              VISOR is implemented in python 3.6, open-source and freely available at https://github.com/davidebolo1993/VISOR. Documentation is available at https://davidebolo1993.github.io/visordoc/.

	abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant neoplasm of terminally differentiated immunoglobulin-producing B lymphocytes called plasma cells. MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy, and it poses a heavy economic and social burden because it remains incurable and confers a profound disability to patients. Despite current progress in MM treatment, the disease invariably recurs, even after the transplantation of autologous hematopoietic stem cells (ASCT). Biological processes leading to a pathological myeloma clone and the mechanisms of further evolution of the disease are far from complete understanding. Genetically, MM is a complex disease that demonstrates a high level of heterogeneity. Myeloma genomes carry numerous genetic changes, including structural genome variations and chromosomal gains and losses, and these changes occur in combinations with point mutations affecting various cellular pathways, including genome maintenance. MM genome instability in its extreme is manifested in mutation kataegis and complex genomic rearrangements: chromothripsis, templated insertions, and chromoplexy. Chemotherapeutic agents used to treat MM add another level of complexity because many of them exacerbate genome instability. Genome abnormalities are driver events and deciphering their mechanisms will help understand the causes of MM and play a pivotal role in developing new therapies.},

A crucial component of this endeavour is the discovery and characterization of structural variants (SVs), which are ubiquitous in the human population, heterogeneous in their mutational processes, key substrates for evolution and adaptation, and profound drivers of human disease. The recent emergence of new technologies and the remarkable scale of sequence-based population studies have begun to crystalize our understanding of SVs as a mutational class and their widespread influence across phenotypes. In this Review, we summarize recent discoveries and new insights into SVs in the human genome in terms of their mutational patterns, population genetics, functional consequences, and impact on human traits and disease. We conclude by outlining three frontiers to be explored by the field over the next decade.},

We also establish best practices for benchmarking SV detection algorithms across the entire genome in a data-driven manner using replication and read-backed phasing analysis. Through the analysis of matched Illumina and nanopore whole-genome sequencing data for 99 human tumor-normal pairs, we show that SAVANA has significantly higher sensitivity and 13- and 82-times-higher specificity than the second and third-best performing algorithms. Moreover, SVs reported by SAVANA are highly consistent with those detected using short-read sequencing. In summary, SAVANA enables the application of long-read sequencing to detect SVs and SCNAs reliably.},

Here, we present Severus, a breakpoint graph-based algorithm for somatic SV calling from long-read cancer sequencing. Severus works with matching normal samples, supports unbalanced cancer karyotypes, can characterize complex multibreak SV patterns and produces haplotype-specific calls. On a comprehensive multitechnology cell line panel, Severus consistently outperforms other long-read and short-read methods in terms of SV detection F1 score (harmonic mean of the precision and recall). We also illustrate that compared to long-read methods, short-read sequencing systematically misses certain classes of somatic SVs, such as insertions or clustered rearrangements. We apply Severus to several clinical cases of pediatric leukemia/lymphoma, revealing clinically relevant cryptic rearrangements missed by standard genomic panels.},

Furthermore, Sniffles2 solves the problem of family-level to population-level SV calling to produce fully genotyped VCF files. Across 11 probands, we accurately identified causative SVs around MECP2, including highly complex alleles with three overlapping SVs. Sniffles2 also enables the detection of mosaic SVs in bulk long-read data. As a result, we identified multiple mosaic SVs in brain tissue from a patient with multiple system atrophy. The identified SV showed a remarkable diversity within the cingulate cortex, impacting both genes involved in neuron function and repetitive elements.},

	abstract = {There are two major paradigms in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology: short-read sequencing and long-read sequencing. Short-read sequencing approaches provide lower-cost, higher-accuracy data that are useful for population-level research and clinical variant discovery. By contrast, long-read approaches provide read lengths that are well suited for de novo genome assembly applications and full-length isoform sequencing.NGS technologies have been evolving over the past 10 years, leading to substantial improvements in quality and yield; however, certain approaches have proven to be more effective and adaptable than others.Recent improvements in chemistry, costs, throughput and accessibility are driving the emergence of new, varied technologies to address applications that were not previously possible. These include integrated long-read and short-read sequencing studies, routine clinical DNA sequencing, real-time pathogen DNA monitoring and massive population-level projects.Although massive strides are being made in this technology, several notable limitations remain. The time required to sequence and analyse data limits the use of NGS in clinical applications in which time is an important factor; the costs and error rates of long-read sequencing make it prohibitive for routine use, and ethical considerations can limit the public and private use of genetic data.We can expect increasing democratization and options for NGS in the future. Many new instruments with varied chemistries and applications are being released or being developed.},

Next-generation sequencing has provided a snapshot of the genetic landscape of most cancer types, and cancer genomics approaches are driving new insights into cancer evolutionary patterns in time and space. In contrast to species evolution, cancer is a particular case owing to the vast size of tumour cell populations, chromosomal instability and its potential for phenotypic plasticity. Nevertheless, an evolutionary framework is a powerful aid to understand cancer progression and therapy failure. Indeed, such a framework could be applied to predict individual tumour behaviour and support treatment strategies.},

There are dozens of HGP-like projects which involve from a few tens to several million genomes currently in progress, which vary from having specialized goals or a more general approach. However, data generation, storage, management and analysis in public and private cloud computing platforms have raised concerns about privacy and security. The knowledge gained from further research has changed the field of genomics and is now slowly permeating into clinical medicine. The new precision (personalized) medicine, where genome sequencing and data analysis are essential components, allows tailored diagnosis and treatment according to the information from the patient’s own genome and specific environmental factors. P4 (predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory) medicine is introducing new concepts, challenges and opportunities. This review summarizes current sequencing technologies, concentrates on ongoing human genomics projects, and provides some examples in which precision medicine has already demonstrated clinical impact in diagnosis and/or treatment.},

	abstract = {Cancer treatments have evolved from indiscriminate cytotoxic agents to selective genome- and immune-targeted drugs that have transformed the outcomes of some malignancies1. Tumor complexity and heterogeneity suggest that the ‘precision medicine’ paradigm of cancer therapy requires treatment to be personalized to the individual patient2–6. To date, precision oncology trials have been based on molecular matching with predetermined monotherapies7–14. Several of these trials have been hindered by very low matching rates, often in the 5–10\% range15, and low response rates. Low matching rates may be due to the use of limited gene panels, restrictive molecular matching algorithms, lack of drug availability, or the deterioration and death of end-stage patients before therapy can be implemented. We hypothesized that personalized treatment with combination therapies would improve outcomes in patients with refractory malignancies. As a first test of this concept, we implemented a cross-institutional prospective study (I-PREDICT, NCT02534675) that used tumor DNA sequencing and timely recommendations for individualized treatment with combination therapies. We found that administration of customized multidrug regimens was feasible, with 49\% of consented patients receiving personalized treatment. Targeting of a larger fraction of identified molecular alterations, yielding a higher ‘matching score’, was correlated with significantly improved disease control rates, as well as longer progression-free and overall survival rates, compared to targeting of fewer somatic alterations. Our findings suggest that the current clinical trial paradigm for precision oncology, which pairs one driver mutation with one drug, may be optimized by treating molecularly complex and heterogeneous cancers with combinations of customized agents.},

Given the variability in SV type and size, along with unique detection biases of emerging genomic platforms, multiplatform discovery is necessary to resolve the full spectrum of variation.

We applied our protocol to cell lines and brain tissue samples as part of a pilot project for the National Institutes of Health Center for Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias. Using a single PromethION flow cell, we can detect single nucleotide polymorphisms with F1-score comparable to Illumina short-read sequencing. Small indel calling remains difficult within homopolymers and tandem repeats, but achieves good concordance to Illumina indel calls elsewhere. Further, we can discover structural variants with F1-score on par with state-of-the-art de novo assembly methods.

By analyzing the obtained phasing information, we reveal that several cancer genomes harbor regions in which mutations are unevenly distributed to either of two haplotypes. Large-scale chromosomal rearrangement events, which resemble chromothripsis events but have smaller scales, occur on only one chromosome, and these events account for the observed biased distributions. Interestingly, the events are characteristic of EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinomas. Further integration of long read epigenomic and transcriptomic data reveal that haploid chromosomes are not always at equivalent transcriptomic/epigenomic conditions. Distinct chromosomal backgrounds are responsible for later cancerous aberrations in a haplotype-specific manner.},

	abstract = {A key mutational process in cancer is structural variation, in which rearrangements delete, amplify or reorder genomic segments that range in size from kilobases to whole chromosomes1–7. Here we develop methods to group, classify and describe somatic structural variants, using data from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which aggregated whole-genome sequencing data from 2,658 cancers across 38 tumour types8. Sixteen signatures of structural variation emerged. Deletions have a multimodal size distribution, assort unevenly across tumour types and patients, are enriched in late-replicating regions and correlate with inversions. Tandem duplications also have a multimodal size distribution, but are enriched in early-replicating regions—as are unbalanced translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy-number gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent structure consists of 2–7 templates copied from distinct regions of the genome strung together within one locus. Such cycles of templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, and—in liver cancer—frequently activate the telomerase gene TERT. A wide variety of rearrangement processes are active in cancer, which generate complex configurations of the genome upon which selection can act.},

Here, we stratify TDP tumors by classifying their tandem duplications (TDs) into three span intervals, with modal values of 11 kb, 231 kb, and 1.7 Mb, respectively. TDPs with ∼11 kb TDs feature loss of TP53 and BRCA1. TDPs with ∼231 kb and ∼1.7 Mb TDs associate with CCNE1 pathway activation and CDK12 disruptions, respectively. We demonstrate that p53 and BRCA1 conjoint abrogation drives TDP induction by generating short-span TDP mammary tumors in genetically modified mice lacking them. Lastly, we show how TDs in TDP tumors disrupt heterogeneous combinations of tumor suppressors and chromatin topologically associating domains while duplicating oncogenes and super-enhancers.},

When published, a new method is commonly compared with those already available, but this tends to be selective and incomplete. The lack of comprehensive benchmarking of methods presents challenges for users in selecting methods and for developers in understanding algorithm behaviours and limitations. Here we report the comprehensive evaluation of 10 SV callers, selected following a rigorous process and spanning the breadth of detection approaches, using high-quality reference cell lines, as well as simulations. Due to the nature of available truth sets, our focus is on general-purpose rather than somatic callers. We characterise the impact on performance of event size and type, sequencing characteristics, and genomic context, and analyse the efficacy of ensemble calling and calibration of variant quality scores.

	abstract = {A key goal of whole-genome sequencing for studies of human genetics is to interrogate all forms of variation, including single-nucleotide variants, small insertion or deletion (indel) variants and structural variants. However, tools and resources for the study of structural variants have lagged behind those for smaller variants. Here we used a scalable pipeline1 to map and characterize structural variants in 17,795 deeply sequenced human genomes. We publicly release site-frequency data to create the largest, to our knowledge, whole-genome-sequencing-based structural variant resource so far. On average, individuals carry 2.9 rare structural variants that alter coding regions; these variants affect the dosage or structure of 4.2 genes and account for 4.0–11.2\% of rare high-impact coding alleles. Using a computational model, we estimate that structural variants account for 17.2\% of rare alleles genome-wide, with predicted deleterious effects that are equivalent to loss-of-function coding alleles; approximately 90\% of such structural variants are noncoding deletions (mean 19.1 per genome). We report 158,991 ultra-rare structural variants and show that 2\% of individuals carry ultra-rare megabase-scale structural variants, nearly half of which are balanced or complex rearrangements. Finally, we infer the dosage sensitivity of genes and noncoding elements, and reveal trends that relate to element class and conservation. This work will help to guide the analysis and interpretation of structural variants in the era of whole-genome sequencing.},

	doi = {10.1038/nrc746},
	abstract = {Multiple myeloma, which is located at multiple sites in the bone-marrow compartment, is a malignant plasma-cell tumour that is characterized by osteolytic bone lesions. It is a slowly proliferating tumour, typically with less than 1\% of tumour cells synthesizing DNA, until late in the disease, when multiple myeloma cells are often found outside the bone marrow. A pre-malignant lesion called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), which is present in 1\% of adults, progresses to malignant multiple myeloma at a rate of 1\% per year. The karyotypes of multiple myeloma are complex, and more similar to those found in epithelial tumours and the blast phase of chronic myelogenous leukaemia than to those in other haematopoietic tumours. Primary translocations — mediated by errors in B-cell-specific DNA modification processes — juxtapose one or more oncogenes and immunoglobulin transcriptional regulatory regions in ∼50\% of MGUS and multiple myelomas. In contrast to other B-cell malignancies, these translocations simultaneously dysregulate a variety of oncogenes, such as the genes for cyclin D1 or D3, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) combined with the nuclear protein MMSET, and the transcription factor c-MAF. Secondary translocations that do not involve B-cell-specific processes contribute to progression by dysregulating other oncogenes. Although c-MYC is dysregulated by primary translocations in some B-cell malignancies, it is dysregulated by secondary translocations, often without involvement of an immunogloublin locus, as myeloma tumours become more proliferative at a late stage of progression. Genetic changes are similar in pre-malignant MGUS and multiple myeloma, although the latter is distinguished by the presence of activating mutations of NRAS or KRAS2, and also a higher incidence of monosomy 13, indicating a possible tumour-suppressor gene on chromosome 13. Normal plasma cells, as well as MGUS and multiple myeloma cells, are dependent on the bone-marrow microenvironment for survival, growth and differentiation. These processes are, in part, mediated by paracrine interleukin-6 and insulin-like growth factor 1. The evolving interaction of multiple myeloma cells with the bone-marrow microenvironment is also involved in the secondary effects of malignancy, including osteolysis, anaemia and immunodeficiency. Multiple myeloma is an incurable malignancy for which the median survival has remained fixed at about 3 years for the past decade. Although MGUS can be efficiently diagnosed by a simple blood test, it is not possible to prevent progression or even predict when progression to myeloma will occur. Recent advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of these tumours indicate that improved approaches for prevention and treatment should be possible in the near future.},

	abstract = {Nanopore sequencing, a third-generation sequencing technology, has revolutionized the gene sequencing industry with its advantages of long reads, fast speed, real-time sequencing and analysis, and potential in detecting base modifications. This technology allows researchers to sequence longer DNA fragments in a single read, providing more comprehensive genomic information compared to previous methods. Nanopore sequencing operates on electrical signals generated by a nanopore embedded in a membrane separating two electrolyte-filled chambers. When single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) passes through the nanopore, it creates variations in the current that correspond to different DNA bases. By analyzing these current fluctuations with machine learning algorithms, the DNA sequence can be determined. In this study, we introduced several improvements to nanopore sequencing, including nanopore local chemistry sequencing, novel motor and pore proteins, chip design, and basecalling algorithms. Our new nanopore sequencing platform, CycloneSEQ, demonstrated long-duration sequencing (107 hours) on a single chip with high yield ({\textgreater}50 Gb). In human genomic DNA sequencing, CycloneSEQ was able to produce long reads with N50 33.6 kb and modal identity 97.0\%. Preliminary findings on human whole-genome de novo assembly, variant calling, metagenomics sequencing, and single-cell RNA sequencing have further highlighted CycloneSEQ’s potential across different areas of genomics.},

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this project was to implement long-read sequencing for BCR-ABL1 TKI resistance mutation screening in a clinical setting for patients undergoing treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia.
Materials and Methods: Processes were established for registering and transferring samples from the clinic to an academic sequencing facility for long-read sequencing. An automated analysis pipeline for detecting mutations was established, and an information system was implemented comprising features for data management, analysis and visualization. Clinical validation was performed by identifying BCR-ABL1 TKI resistance mutations by Sanger and long-read sequencing in parallel. The developed software is available as open source via GitHub at https://github.com/pharmbio/clamp
Results: The information system enabled traceable transfer of samples from the clinic to the sequencing facility, robust and automated analysis of the long-read sequence data, and communication of results from sequence analysis in a reporting format that could be easily interpreted and acted upon by clinical experts. In a validation study, all 17 resistance mutations found by Sanger sequencing were also detected by long-read sequencing. An additional 16 mutations were found only by long-read sequencing, all of them with frequencies below the limit of detection for Sanger sequencing. The clonal distributions of co-existing mutations were automatically resolved through the long-read data analysis. After the implementation and validation, the clinical laboratory switched their routine protocol from using Sanger to long-read sequencing for this application.
Conclusions: Long-read sequencing delivers results with higher sensitivity compared to Sanger sequencing and enables earlier detection of emerging TKI resistance mutations. The developed processes, analysis workflow, and software components lower barriers for adoption and could be extended to other applications.},

	abstract = {Targeted immunotherapies against B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) have transformed the treatment landscape of Multiple Myeloma (MM). Fc receptor-like 5 (FCRL5) has emerged as an alternative target. However, resistance frequently emerges within months, posing a significant clinical challenge. Structural alterations and mutations in BCMA only account for the minority of cases and insights into BCMA antigen escape remain largely unknown. This study investigates novel (epi)genetic mechanisms of antigen escape through comprehensive multi-omic Oxford Nanopore profiling of sequential pre-treatment and relapse samples. We identify acquired DNA-hypermethylation across the entire BCMA gene, and hypermethylation of the FCRL5 promoter, both resulting in epigenetic gene silencing as novel resistance mechanisms through which MM cells evade therapy. These findings underscore the dynamic clonal evolution of MM under therapeutic pressure and highlight the critical role of epigenetic modifications in resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of advanced sequencing technologies for capturing epigenetic and complex genomic alterations in clinical settings, paving the way for personalized treatment strategies and predictive biomarkers for early resistance detection.
Statement of significance Acquired DNA hypermethylation of BCMA and FCRL5 regulatory regions, leading to gene expression downregulation, represent novel epigenetic resistance mechanisms to anti-BCMA and anti-FCRL5 immunotherapies. Furthermore, DNA methylation marks serve as a molecular memory of therapeutic pressure, capturing the treatment history of cancer cells.},

	abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder with potential secondary organ effects including renal, bone, and bone marrow effects as well as neurologic and immune dysfunction. Diagnostic evaluation of MM includes laboratory and radiologic studies along with bone marrow biopsy to confirm diagnosis. Multiple myeloma is a clonal plasma cell malignancy that results from complex interactions between malignant progenitor cells, bone marrow stromal cells, and the bone marrow microenvironment. Multiple myeloma is clinically and pathologically heterogeneous, which results in variability in treatment response and survival. The disease trajectory varies for each patient, but relapses are inevitable and many patients become refractory to treatments. Management of relapsed and refractory (RR) MM requires careful evaluation of individual patient characteristics and the course of the disease. When determining treatment options for patients with RR MM, comorbidities, the frailty and vulnerability of the patient, and the specific adverse event profile associated with each treatment should be considered, as well as the patient's goals. The goal of therapy for patients with RR MM is to achieve disease control with acceptable toxicity and quality of life, which may be accomplished with novel agents, most likely in combination regimens. The integration of these novel agents into the treatment paradigm has shifted the perception of MM from incurable to a disease that may be considered chronic in the near future with a hope for long-term survival and maintained quality of life.},

In addition to improving prognostication and identification of HRMM, this represents a pivotal turning point in MM management: after more than 20 years, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) alone is no longer sufficient, and DNA sequencing needs to be incorporated into the arena.},

	abstract = {A common signature of cancer genomes is a complex, rearranged karyotype, characterized by acquired gains or losses of chromosomal material, referred to as somatic copy number alterations (CNAs). Identification of haplotype-specific CNAs from bulk sequencing data is a key step in many short-read cancer genomic workflows; however, short reads have a limited phasing range. In contrast, long reads can directly phase genomic variants into contiguous haplotypes. Here, we present Wakhan, a long-read method for haplotype-specific CNA calling that can reconstruct longer, up to chromosome-scale CNA profiles of rearranged cancer genomes. Using multi-technology sequencing of a cell line panel, combined with high-quality de novo assemblies, we show that Wakhan CNA profiles have better consistency with sequencing data, as compared to the other popular short- and long-read CNA callers. Further, we show that in combination with accurate somatic SV calls, Wakhan CNA profiles provide additional insights into mutational processes in various breast cancer genomes. Finally, we apply Wakhan to multiple pediatric cancer samples and illustrate the high consistency with standard clinical genetic testing.},

	abstract = {Since its initial release in 2001, the human reference genome has undergone continuous improvement in quality, and the recently released telomere-to-telomere (T2T) version — T2T-CHM13 — reaches its highest level of continuity and accuracy after 20 years of effort by working on a simplified, nearly homozygous genome of a hydatidiform mole cell line. Here, to provide an authentic complete diploid human genome reference for the Han Chinese, the largest population in the world, we assembled the genome of a male Han Chinese individual, T2T-YAO, which includes T2T assemblies of all the 22 + X + M and 22 + Y chromosomes in both haploids. The quality of T2T-YAO is much better than those of all currently available diploid assemblies, and its haploid version, T2T-YAO-hp, generated by selecting the better assembly for each autosome, reaches the top quality of fewer than one error per 29.5 Mb, even higher than that of T2T-CHM13. Derived from an individual living in the aboriginal region of the Han population, T2T-YAO shows clear ancestry and potential genetic continuity from the ancient ancestors. Each haplotype of T2T-YAO possesses ∼ 330-Mb exclusive sequences, ∼ 3100 unique genes, and tens of thousands of nucleotide and structural variations as compared with CHM13, highlighting the necessity of a population-stratified reference genome. The construction of T2T-YAO, an accurate and authentic representative of the Chinese population, would enable precise delineation of genomic variations and advance our understandings in the hereditability of diseases and phenotypes, especially within the context of the unique variations of the Chinese population.},
